## üöÄ Installation

**Warning:** Feel free to give these dotfiles a try. However, I advise you to
fork this repository first and look around. Get a feel of what it will set up
for you and remove things you don‚Äôt want or need. Don‚Äôt blindly use my settings
unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

The repo used to provide a central installation script to install
single configurations or all of them at once. This script was written using the
[bashly](https://bashly.dannyb.co/) framework, an amazing tool that allows for
robust and standardized bash scripts. For reference, I kept this paragraph
here.

As the project evolved, I switched to a dotfile management framework:
[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

As time progressed, dotbot proved to be harder to maintain and I decided to
switch to _stow_.
Tools and configurations are grouped in _packages_, i.e. cli for everything related
to cli tools, editor for editors, etc.
To install a package simply run
`bash
stow <package-name>
`

## üß© Fonts

My terminal uses the [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font,
made for developers with a bunch of useful features and symbols.

# References

This repo takes inspiration from [this](https://github.com/benmatselby/dotfiles)
fellow developer dotfiles repo. I know there are probably thousands of similar
repos, but that is the one that I stumbled across first.

## üõ† Notes

There are some tools in this list written in Rust.
I stumbled across [this video](https://youtu.be/dFkGNe4oaKk)
that showed me those nice tools.
They do compile practically everywhere and are some of
the fastest options in the market,
therefore I decided to give them a try. As more and more rust video will surely
flood my home (thanks youtube algorithm), I'm sure that list will be updated.
