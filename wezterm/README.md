# [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)

An amazing terminal emulator written in Rust
and completely configurable in lua. It also comes with
multiplexer features out of the box, supporting panes, windows and tabs.

I've tinkered a bit with its configuration taking ideas from
[this](https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles/tree/main) fellow developer dotfiles.

After stumbling across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3kpsbbERo&pp=ugMICgJpdBABGAHKBQ5kZXZvcHMgdG9vbGJvYw%3D%3D)
tmux video,
I decided to focus more on panes and windows
rather than using the wezterm multiplexer.
I therefore changed its configuration and
changed theme as well to fit the new look.
